For starters, we tried the gnome fish sashimi  which we never heard of, young snapper sashimi,  and salmon roll.  The fish and especially the  salmon roll blew my tastebuds away!  I never knew salmon can melt in your mouth like butter.   For entree we shared the yummy Pork Belly Two Ways that was cooked perfectly and finished off with the shiso flan (also delicious).

He stated up front that while he saw that they had made a mistake, he would only send us one replacement burrito (rather than both our dinners) because we had eaten &quot;more than one bite.&quot;  After ordering from El Paso at least once a month for 5 years, we were hardly trying to scam them out of a $7 burrito.

We started with the tuna tartar, which was absolutely fantastic. The members of our group ordered the roasted Provencal chicken, which was adequate, and 2 rare Illinois rib eyes (8 oz and 12 oz). The sides were garlic mash potatoes (watery and no trace of garlic) and grilled asparagus (seriously - 10 bucks for 10 aparagus???).    The 12 oz steak was cooked perfectly and exactly what one would expect. The 8 oz steak however was a SCHANDE. The outer color was more grey than seared, the inside was medium and the taste was that of a piece of meat that had been in the freezer too long and flash thawed. After complaining about the quality of the meat (which the absolutely lovely waitress agreed didn&#39;t look right) we were provided with another steak that had all the same lousy attributes of the first. We ultimately shared the 12 oz and wound up paying 32 dollars for a steak that was subpar and could not be eaten.

If you can appreciate the difference and are not an obnoxious snob then you&#39;ll like this place.  While it originated in 17th century Italy, what pizza is to the world today originated in NYC (Lombardi&#39;s 1905).  La Nonna is a very good pizzeria and a very good value.

The pizza dough is way to dry, the mozzarella looks and taste like melted wax, the quality of the toppings is all off. The other dishes are simply boring if not bad.

Started with the lobster soup, which was more like beef broth ... I assume they made it by boiling lobster shells in some sort of stock. Then on to barbeque chicken on herb mac and cheese. Sounds good, right? While the portion was huge, I had no interest in either finishing it or taking it home. The chicken was overcooked, the mac was absolutely tasteless and loaded with undercooked, starchy peas. There was also a hard-boiled egg on the plate that was so dry, it was virtually inedible. The only seasoning that jumped out at me was salt, salt, and more salt. The desserts were equally unimpressive ... an apple tarte so tough it needed a knife to eat it, panne cotta drowning in pureed fruit that resembled a smoothie ... and when we got the bill, they had charged us for an extra meal. Fortunately, we double-checked the numbers. When this was pointed out to the waiter, he didn&#39;t even apologize. We could have overpaid by $40!

So 45 minutes later we finally complained to a female waitress and she tried her best to serve us expeditiously. Ofcourse we still had to wait because the order had never been placed initially. Our waiter (the male) continued to ignore us with no apology. You don&#39;t expect those service issues at a David Burke restaurant.

Arriving in NY with 2 hours to burn before our hair salon appointment, we decided to have lunch in SoHo.  We looked up restaurants and thought that David Burke&#39;s Kitchen&#39;s menu items looked good and though there were negative reviews, there were more complaints about service than about their food. We figured maybe their food would be good enough to put up with poor service.  Were we wrong!  Our bread basket came, without the slices of bread. Unlike the others around us, we only had the tiny breadsticks, some grapes and three tiny baguette slices. When we asked what the butter was sitting on, the waiter used his pen to touch the block of sea salt.  The lobster soup came out tepid, not hot.  Afterwaiting for more than 20 minutes for the waffles and fried chicken (there were only about 7 other diners in the entire restaurant at that time, and the chefs who could be seen from the dining area were just standing around shooting the breeze!), the waffles came out burnt! How can a restaurant, a reputable one at that, even find it acceptable to serve burnt food?? Though they did take the waffles back and the ones we got the second time around were a little better, they were mediocre.  The only decent item we ordered was the lollipop tree for two dessert. While it was different, it was not good enough to salvage our experience at DB&#39;s Kitchen. We have been to a lot better lesser known restaurants in NY.

First impression was not good - I waited over an HOUR despite my reservation and being on time at the expensive bar, where the tab was presented with every drink (hint hint).  Once seated, with no apology for the wait, not only did I see the same crab cake with pretzel stick crust (2 great tastes - not great together) appetizer from the Townhouse, but the cheesecake lollies were also there.  Meh.  I went a new way and had a so-so salad that had large, sweet dried apricots (which overwhelmed), and the duck with fioe gras.  The duck was rare, and an overly firm texture, and the fioe gras was coated in a corny crust.  The effect was overdone and overly sweet and rich.  Finished with tea and &quot;The Stove&quot; -which to my astonishment was a model cast iron stove (Think Little House on the Prarie) with cookies laid on it and a candle.  I was self conscious eating from the stove because people could NOT stop staring!  And boy did people stare.  It was a scene of wannebe scenesters.   We had no fewer than 4 wait people at once, and it was never clear who was taking care of us.  The overall effect was scattered, and the service, so-so.

Again , I was  speaking  to a person in corporate who put me  on a 10 min  hold and said it was his 1st day..after I got upset.  When we walked in we were asked to check our coats..a real nuisance since it&#39;s on the 2nd floor! I think it would have been nicer if someone at the reception desk would have offered to take our coats instead of sending us upstairs. Also when we left it was the same story and it was a BIG annoying line to get our coats! We started with salads and all 4 that arrived on the table were CoLD!

I work as a manager in Food Service and would love to work here. I always feel taken care of, even when my Martini has been sitting there awhile a fresh chilled glass appears and the drink is transferred. Who does that?? The Food while not imaginative is VERY good for what it is. And the flavor profiles of the dishes make it more than ordinary. In fact if you want American fare at it&#39;s best it&#39;s hard to find it better than here in NYC. That having been said it is pricey and they do have some strange rules about seating and sharing, but given the level of service they are trying to have I understand the strategy and it does not bother me.

We were afraid that it had become a new place but were assured that it was just a name change and that there were more items on the menu. I have always come for the ribs, a real favorite. The meat seems the same but the sauce was way overdone. It overwhelmed the ribs. One of us had ordered the ribs without the sauce and it came sauced anyway.

It is a great lounge with comfortable couches, military like tables and killer views of Central Park. The food is the same as inside, except you can have a drink and order individual courses. Not cheap, but way less than the extravaganza inside. Had a great five course meal and they added some to it. Incredible and a super way to taste the best in a more casual setting. Service as always fabulous and friendly. Go for it!!!

I&#39;ve had many expensive wonderful dinners in NYC, which were on the order of $300 for 2.  Here we paid more than $800 and honestly I would not have gone back if it was much less than that.  Overall I would recommend to perhaps check out their bar menu to try things out, save some cash and still be able to tell people that you went to Per Se.  But I do see that most other reviews are very positive, so perhaps my view is a little off...'),(295,'Per Se','SCRogers','2010-10-18','Wonderful','Absolutely Delicious !! Absolutely !!

If you have visited other Michelin star restaurants then you will not be surprised in Per Se. Service is fast (little bit conveyor feeling) and little bit too cold and formal.   Servants are not so well trained to make nicely smooth and synchronized  serving if there is more than one person in table. Extra remark I like to make about how they are spilling water, wines and champagnes. There is lot of room for improvement (bottle holding and spilling speed - you don&#39;t have to hurry and splash with drinks).  Food was visually nicely composed but from Chefs Tasting Menu I expected more emotions for my tongue and mind. But still pleased with food.   Per Se is not my first recommendation for people who looking 3star Michelin experience in New York. Dinner for two with champagne - approx 1000 USD.   P.S.

The view was enjoyable but is it worth the hefty price??'),(304,'The River Cafe','HHB','2010-06-20','Tavern on the Green, Brooklyn','I have to agree with the anonymous reviewer below. I went for brunch with a friend, just to check it out, and while the setting and view were spectacular, the food was only so-so, and very expensive for what it was. Truly, it felt like I stepped through a time warp into the 80&#39;s. The food was the same, the staff was uptight and took themselves very seriously, and the place was loaded with tourists. It was a prix-fixe for $55, appetizer &amp; main course. I had the Smoked Rainbow Trout, my friend had the salad. The salad was nice, but nothing special (how can you screw up salad, really?). The trout was hot (I&#39;d the impression it would be cold) and again, very nice, but nothing to get too excited about. For main courses, I had the Maine Lobster Omelette, she had the Scottish Salmon. She seemed to like her salmon, but I only got about half way through the omelette - it was very salty, with very little lobster in it, mostly gooey cheese. The best part of the meal were the desserts; she had the goat cheese cheesecake and I had the Chocolate Toffee Sticky Pudding. She seemed to like the cheesecake, and I can definitely say the pudding was fantastic. Service was fine, a bit of attitude, but nothing too obnoxious. All in all, except for the view, there are so many places with better food that cost less. Go there. As I said in my title, this really strikes me as the Brooklyn equivalent of Tavern on the Green, where everyone goes for the setting and no one goes for the food, even though it&#39;s horribly expensive, and no local will be caught dead in here.'),(305,'The River Cafe','anonymous','2010-04-05','Not quite in the league it thinks it is','It&#39;s sad, given the gorgeous space, the beautiful view, the ambiance, that the food is just not quite up to where it&#39;s price thinks it is. You&#39;re paying for that scenery, no question, not what&#39;s on your plate.    The food is good, mind you, just not $98 prix fixe good. That&#39;s a higher PF than Gremercy Tavern, even higher than the recently four-starred Eleven Madison Park. Is the food at River Cafe on that level? In a word, no.    There&#39;s hasn&#39;t been a chef at River Cafe who equalled the surroundings in quite some time. The days of Charlie Palmers and David Burkes gracing the kitchen are long in the past. They seem geared towards producing quality high-end food without being terribly inventive now - the chefs who pass through are blue-chippers on the way up, but no one that&#39;s going to set the culinary world on fire. Certainly no one who warrants a $98 Prix Fixe at this point in their career.    Simply put, there&#39;s no reason to pay the price for dinner at the River Cafe except for the view. For foodies, there are too many restaurants where you&#39;ll get a better meal for a lower price. It&#39;s become a restaurant that coasts on its &quot;legendary Old NY&quot; status a la The Four Seasons or The Russian Tea Room.    It would be great to see a really talented young chef - one with a bit of a pedigree and a little name recognition who wants to take things to the next level - come in and shake things up a bit. And lower the price to a more reasonable $75 or so - or perhaps go a la carte - putting it in line with equivalent menus elsewhere. Until then, it&#39;s a &quot;don&#39;t bother&quot; as far as I&#39;m concerned.'),(306,'The River Cafe','anonymous','2010-01-03','msg to ed hobbs','Just an FYI, even though they included the service charge on the bill, you can always add more tip to the deserving staffs.

The mussel special was fine, but the garlic bread it&#39;s served with is dripping with oil.  The striped bass has no taste.   The worst offense, however, is what they&#39;re doing to the octopus - they&#39;re taking the skin off, grilling it like a sausage and covering it in a sickeningly-sweet sauce.  It&#39;s barely recognizable as octopus and left a terrible taste in our mouths (literally and figuratively) for the rest of the evening.

At first, the waiter and servers stopped by too often.

Once we had the food, some dishes were good, some were just okay.  I would not recommend the skirt steak but would recommend the cauliflower fritters.  After eating for 10 minutes, servers started stopping by every two minutes to see if we were done with anything.  We told them all no but once the third or fourth one asked us, it really started to disrupt our meal.  Then they all disappeared.  The last course we ordered did not arrive for another 35-40 minutes and by that time we were ready to leave.  There was an error on the bill but the waiter promptly fixed it with an explanation that they did not yet know the computer system.

The usual any thing passes for Caesar Salad &quot;Pseudo-Caesar Salad&quot; was some red-leaf lettuce with parmesean in vinagrette. The other appetizer of a jumbo shrimp cocktail raised my suspicions when I noticed their glossy sheen. Confirmation of probably packaged, frozen crustaceans were confirmed by  their mushy texture and slighty off, butt not spoiled taste. A ketchupy cocktail sauce helped disguise the taste.  For the main we both had Colorado lamb chops. Their charred appearance was explained after tasting them and coming to the sad realization they were char-broiled a la` Roy Rogers Steakhouse.

And while the &quot;meat&quot;ball sub was awesome (if not a little small), the bean burrito was mostly lettuce and maybe a tablespoon of beans.    The vegan cupcakes are good, as are most of the vegan cakes. But every cookie I&#39;ve had here TASTES like its trying really hard to be &quot;vegan&quot;...and sacrificing taste as a result.

I asked the waiter if he could exchange it for the thai salad that I&#39;d had at my first visit. He hesitated, looked at me funny, then slapped his hands down and huffed away, turned back around, stood still and glared at me, then went to the cook. He came back with a tiny side of thai salad. I asked why I wasn&#39;t being given the full portion and he said that I&#39;d eaten half the sandwich (seriously, 2 bites), so I was only getting half a salad. I asked to speak with a manager and he came back with more lettuce on top of the same salad on a side salad plate.

The ceviche was cold, so you can clearly taste that it was not fresh (the potato, and the corn were just out of the fridge).  The best ceviche is made at the moment, and in Peru, others just let it rest for 30 minutes, and serve it at room temperature.  This ceviche was probably made the day before and stored in the fridge.   Same thing with Papa a la Huancaina.  The lomo saltado was not good (such a simple dish).

I realize that this is the &quot;Hot Spot&quot; but it was over crowded!! It was way more than 290 ppl jammed in there based on the capacity sign on the wall. Our reservation was @ 9:45. We didnt even get to our table or should I say tables until 10:30. They gave us two tables We were confirmed  One large table.  Clearly NOT enough room for our party size. We sat down for the 1st time, my gf complained and they brought two baby tables to go btween the two large tables. We all had to get up again and stand around  bumping into other tables *no room* and wait for them to set the table again. At the end it looked like the kiddie table at Thanksgiving at your grandparents house. Still not enough room. My gf complained AGAIN! Two guests couldnt even sit down and our chairs were all against one another. We GOT UP AGAIN *2nd time*!!! They clear the tables and bring in this HUGE long table top. We sit down again and it is reset. By this time is 11:30!  What was really frustrating was that this was planned two months in advance with a contract and a guarantee on the amount of ppl, so management was well aware of how many ppl were going to be there. We were standing around more than enjoying her birthday. The food was crap!  For $128 dollars.. I got one curry covered shrimp, one end of a chain restaurant like pizza, two stems of broccolini, one slice of chicken a size of a chicken nugget, 1/8 a cup of lemon/pesto pasta, and four fries. WOW.. I have traveled to Barcelona and have had true tapas style food and this was just crap, over priced and over salted!! The ONLY plus was that we got free champagne in the bathroom however, if you could get through the crowd to get to the bathroom and back to our table you had to convince the security that.. 1)  we have a reservation 2) We  were already at dinner...

The brussel sprouts were so salty we couldn&#39;t finish the small side dish - No kidding, intolerable.  We had the hominy, too. . . yawn.  The short rib preparation in the tamales was ok but the toppings were completely bland - shredded lettuce and diced tomato - at least squirt some lime over it or add a medium-flavored crumbled cheese; something.  The lobster taceos were bland and boring too - jalopeno crema?  How about hollow-tasting crema.  No small accomplishment to make a bland lobster dish.  And here&#39;s the clincher - I don&#39;t even remember what we had for dessert. Yikes.

It has it&#39;s pros and cons. Pros- the chicken meatballs and mushroom gravy were very good, and so was the salad du jour. The ice cream sandwiches were delicious and I liked that you could choose two different cookie flavors. The service was mostly good, although we did get a bit of an attitude when we asked that the blaring music be turned down. The prices are reasonable even though it&#39;s located in the &quot;now hip and trendy&quot; Lower East Side. Cons- the place is very small and the music is so loud it&#39;s very hard to hear your dining companion. (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s like this all the time or just at &quot;dining prime-time,&quot; so going at lunch it might be better.) The beef meatballs were dry and disappointing, and the tomato sauce on them lacked flavor. The polenta served as a side was also very bland. The ice cream sandwiches had too much ice cream and had to be eaten with a spoon which defeats the purpose of it being a sandwich. The wait can be long, we gave up the first time since the wait was an hour. Some guy on the line said, &quot;it&#39;s worth it&quot;, when we opted to leave instead of wait.

Their  menus are easy - you mark what you want with a marker and hand it in to your very polite and nice waiter!  And the different ways of serving meatballs...To Die For!

There&#39;s even a dish called &quot;everything but the kitchen sink.&quot; What a bargain!  I go to this place all the time and it&#39;s one of the best restaurants in NYC for the prices.

So on the advice of the neighborhood, my roommate and I decided to see for ourselves what the &#39;best meatballs ever&#39; tasted like.  It took numerous attempts to actually get a table, since we never have the patience for an hour long wait, but we kept trying, taking the constant long lines as a sign of good food in our future.  A few days ago, our number was finally called.    The waitress was very helpful in explaining the menu and all the dishes.  I had decided to go with the classic beef meatball and spicy meat sauce.  Before placing the order, I confirmed the type of meat in the spicy meat sauce, and was told it was pork.  Since I don&#39;t eat pork, I opted for the pesto instead.  The waitress then informed me that every dish except the vegetarian meatball was made out of pork.  Now I get it.  People love pork.  I&#39;ve told this story to many of my friends and it has only ignited their interest in checking out this place.  But could it really be that they only serve pork or vegetarian dishes, and nothing in between?  What was really upsetting, was that nowhere on the menu does it say the beef and chicken meatballs contain pork.  I ended up just ordering dessert, and as usual ice cream fixes most problems.  My roommate also enjoyed her vegetarian dish, so there are no complaints about the food they do have.  I was just really looking forward to eating some meatballs.'),(560,'The Meatball Shop','Lola','2010-09-20','Good food/cheap eat','I went here on a Sunday @ 5 pm with my brother and his wife.  After reading the reviews of this place i felt the need to clarify some that i respectfully disagree.  When we arrived to the place we notice that it was packed and was informed that the waiting period was about 20 min. They sat us down 5 min later in the communal table.  The place is tight with loud rock music but cute.  The waitress was super nice and explained the menu in detail.  We placed our orders and were served in 10 min.  The Likes:  Brooklyn lager was delicious just for 5 bucks, the special meatball ( made of steak, bacon and cheese) slider with spicy meat sauce was in my opinion the absolute best meatball on the menu, followed by the classic beef meatball with the spicy meat sauce. The worst:  the spicy pork meatball.  It has a very attractive name but it is a total disappointment. it tastes like spam with spices. Frankly they should eliminate it from the menu. Each slider was 3 bucks each. Bc everyone was raving about the ice cream sandwich, I gave it a try. We order the choc chip w vanilla, the brownie w vanilla and the peanut butter w mint.  Out of all of these I liked the brownie cookie with mint ice cream. The mint tasted like a mojito so you can have it alone if you want as I did since mint with peanut butter is not so brilliant. These were 4 bucks each. Summarizing my experience: delicious food, fair prices, nice ambiance.  Will definately come back and order the BBLT with the special meatball and spicy meat sauce and the brooklyn lager.

Don&#39;t even bother unless you wanna say you&#39;ve gone there','Ay....I had been wanting to go to La Casa del Mofongo ever since I was probably in the sixth grade when I would see the advertisement/commercials on television. Well I finally went in August and let me tell you, it really wasn&#39;t that serious. I am a huge fan of mofongo de camarones (shrimp) so that&#39;s what I ordered. First of all, I was not liking the prices on the menu. Pretty much everything was overpriced/expensive, so I definitely wasn&#39;t going to get two plates of shrimp mofongo ($21.95 each) for me and boyfriend. So we shared instead one order of shrimp mofongo and one plate of chicken soup ($7.95). The soup was a big portion and delicious! Some of the vegetables were a little hard though (probably undercooked) but for the most part, the taste was awesome. As for the mofongo, I did not like it. There was too much garlic. I mean, I love garlic, but there was too much. It overpowered the taste of the shrimp and the sauce. I brushed my teeth that night, woke up the next morning, and STILL had the taste in my mouth. I honestly think that the reason why they&#39;re so overpriced with their mofongo (when it&#39;s not even good) is because of the name of the restaurant. I mean, it&#39;s the Mofongo House, so obviously they&#39;re going to have their mofongos pricey. I have eaten delicious shrimp mofongo back in Puerto Rico for no more than $14 and here, at this Dominican restaurant, it&#39;s more expensive and not to my taste. Plus, the service was bad, but that&#39;s usually typical to the Dominican restaurants I have gone too, so that wasn&#39;t surprising for me at all. My waitress never cleaned the table, took the finished plates back, or even refilled our glasses of water until we left! So our table was stacked with dirty plates during our entire dinner! Trust me, this place is really not that serious. The place is nice, but if you decide to go, make sure you go early! We went at 8 o&#39;clock and made it right before people started to flood into the restaurant! I saw people standing for a little while before they were seated. Overall, try another mofongo spot before coming over here. Now I can say that I&#39;ve finally been there.

We had banana splits for dessert which were pretty good.      My biggest complaint was the waiters came back to the table every 2-3 minutes to pour more wine, and bring new wine to the table without us asking.  Eventually, we just told them no more wine.

Everything on the menu is roughly $10 more per plate than what it should be.  That includes pastas, pollo selections, etc.  The real danger zone is the specials.  These are so far out of line with the menu prices that I find it almost fraudulent that they don&#39;t have them written down with the associated prices.  At a minimum, the servers should say.  I know a lot of people don&#39;t like that thinking it&#39;s cheesy, but when the prices are so off scale from the menu offerings I think it&#39;s the right ethical, not to mention smart, thing to do.  Nothing worse than having a nice meal and then feeling sick after seeing the check.  Those places will never get good word of mouth business and in this economy that&#39;s a big mistake.

A Wall Street banker, I should have never been subjected to this foul fowl in the first place, and establishments like this should be confined to the area behind Port Authority Bus Terminal.    Upon entering, a warm greeting from the barkeep. Decor is spartan, clean. We ordered a large meal deal: 4 drumsticks, 12 wings, 1 side fries and kimchi coleslaw.    We sit, 10 minutes later they holler your number and you get your food from the counter. Fries, delicious. Kimchi? Looked like a combination of thousand islands dressing, string and jello. Traded it back for more fries. Chicken comes on wax paper placed on plastic wicker bowls. Already feeling like I&#39;m at the prison cafeteria with the trays and the yelling out the order numbers, and this disagreeable chow presentation confirms it.    The â&euro;&oelig;chickenâ&euro;? at Bon Chon visually looks like faded plastic, wax, or old plumbing parts. It has the shape of chicken, though, so we tucked in. The sweet and soy tasted like honey and burnt toast. The spicy tasted like honey and that cheap hot sauce they give you in little packets at Mexican-Chinese restaurants. The chicken appears to be wrapped in a cartilage membrane of some sort which deflates a little when you break the seal on it to reveal a steaming little finger of grey meat inside. I focused on the fries and tried to determine if my fellow diners were humans or from that intergalactic bar in Star Wars. No plates, so we divvied up the Culture section of my WSJ and ate off of that.     Meal complete, you bring your tray to a large garbage receptacle where you are reminded with a sign NOT to throw out your plastic wicker device. So now here I am at the trash can, a banking executive, emptying these filthy little bowls full of half eaten chicken clumps and bones, wax paper, soiled bits of newspaper... Taking out the garbage was the only honest work I did all day, and it sure didn&#39;t feel as good as my grampa told me.    Not that price is an object, but the food was pretty cheap. One-up was being able to enjoy my delicious orange Fanta from a real glass with ice - the barkeep even gave me a scoop of cold refreshing ice.

I shared the most delicious thick cut french toast with caramelized bananas and pecans, and an open faced omelet with lobster, onions and spinach with my friend. It tasted as good as it sounds. The rolls and corn sticks were also delicious. Our waiter and the bus boys were more than knowledgeable and attentive. The water glass were filled whenever needed. Then came dessert.

Hostesses and waitstaff were super attentive and very nice (none of the Waverly Inn attitude I&#39;ve grown accustomed to in my neighborhood).      Food was also delicious (and at times nice and spicy).  (I don&#39;t even like guacamole and I ate an entire plat of it at Empellon.)  I&#39;ve been to Mexcio several times (four times this year alone), and the food reminded me of some of my favorite dishes there, but with a decidedly modern twist.    Cocktails are dangerously delicious as well.    Not sure why that kid from Columbia U. wrote such a scathing review - I imagine he has some sort of chip on his shoulder.

It was almost empty at 5:30, just some suits drinking at the bar. The first thing that struck me was how cold the place felt, lots of hard surfaces, black and white, hard tables and chairs, hard tile floor, the only color was a mural behind the bar. The menu is very small and pricey. I had the green bean salad, which was delicious, and the beer braised tongue tacos, also very good, and a cocktail. Portions were modest. I didn&#39;t have the service problems others mentioned, but as I said, the place was nearly empty when I got there. The entire bill for one person, not including tip, was $44, which seems incredibly expensive to me for the food on offer. Yes, it was very nicely put together, but come on. It seems like the antithesis of a West Village restaurant; cold and overpriced, and the clientele was mostly yuppies attracted by the buzz. With all the really good reasonably priced Mexican places out there, I don&#39;t see any need to go here.

My first issue was in dealing with the party planner- it took 2 days for her to respond to a call every time I called; emails were a little easier but it&#39;s aggravating when you just have a few questions.  For $45 a person your guests can choose from 7 selections of your choosing.  This includes coffee and tea only.  That&#39;s the most expensive brunch I&#39;ve ever heard of.  Anyway, since this is the only seemingly respectable place near the church where we attended we had no choice.  We  sat indoors in the main dining room which has large windows all around.  As our guests came in there were no waiters to offer drinks and the buffet servers in the back corner didn&#39;t announce the food was ready or that they were even there.  I saw them standing there, I don&#39;t know how long the food had been ready, but if I hadn&#39;t of just gone up and gotten my food who knows how long people would&#39;ve sat around as there was no prompting or guidance.  After most people got their food my husband asked the hostess about drinks.  He said she seemed surprised that we&#39;d want coffee or tea with our brunch b/c according to her, most people usually have it after the meal.  So, other than ice water, it was a while before servers came and took orders for drinks.  The food itself was mediocre.  The roasted potatoes were dry.  The Belgian waffles that were supposed to have fruit and creme on it had nothing accompanying them and were also dry.  There was a wait for the bacon, twice, b/c there wasn&#39;t enough.  There&#39;s only one omelette maker using one omelette pan at a time so of course there was a line for the omelettes.  The &quot;fresh fruit&quot; selection was a bowl of blueberries/raspberries/blackberries.  The only thing I did enjoy was the mushroom and ham crepes which looked gross but tasted good, and the desserts, which were beautiful and rich.  The person offering coffee splashed mine all over my saucer and on the tablecloth.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the chef worked at an airport hotel restaurant or something.

In the curry - 5 tiny pcs of bamboo shoots, 2 tiny pieces of bell pepper, 1 piece of mushroom and basil.   Summer rolls came apart with dry chicken, dry piece of shrimp and greens that fall out of the rice paper.

However walking into 35 one is whisked away from a deserted street in Tribeca to a tranquil oasis.  The soft leather banquets and sturdy dark wood tables are a compliment to the stone wall and muted purple and pink lighting; the music is present and calming but not too loud that you have to shout over it to talk with your dinner companions.  The service was lovely and prompt, clarifying the differences between the curries and always filling making sure the water glasses were more than half full.  Speaking of the water glasses, their oval shape was whimsical and fun.    Now onto the food.  The calamari was fried in a tempura batter which made it light but a little bland.  A little salt could have gone a long way yet there was a nice little spice to it.  The stir fry glass noodles with chicken at a spice level of 3 which was just the right amount of heat, just enough to get your mouth going but not so much that you start to cry.  While the chicken looked poach and was flavorless by itself, when coated with the sauce it was flavorful with a good kick.  The glass noodles soaked up the sauce and complimented the chicken well.  The curry dishes were a big hit.  The red curry with chicken was scrumptious and the green curry with vegetarian duck was just as delightful.  Non-curry dishes satisfied also; the basil chili noodle was delish.      All in all 35 is a nice little unexpected gem hidden on an empty stretch just a block from bustling Canal Street.'),(820,'35 (Thirty Five)','LM','2010-03-24','Not a fan.

First, it took over 45 minutes for our first course to come, and I ordered French onion soup. It was the most disgusting soup I&#39;ve ever had. The broth was creamy, the cheese had no flavor, and the croutons were burnt. How does a French restaurant not know how to make onion soup? My boyfriend had the calamari, at the waitress&#39; suggestion, and he found a huge piece of squid cartilege. It was not cleaned or prepared properly, and when he asked her what it was, she proceeded to take it out of his hand, walk through the restaurant to ask the chef, and then brought it back to him and explained that it was the bone of the squid, like that was an acceptable explanation! Beside the fact that she took a dirty piece of squid cartilege through the restaurant twice, she didn&#39;t offer to get him something else or really apologize for the fact that he basically had a huge piece of plastic in his food.

The place is really intimate (read as small, cute). The size makes it a bit annoying when the people next to you get up or leave, and you have to move your table. Moving on... we started with a lobster bisque and french onion soup... both were ok. Bisque was the kind with no lobster, and the french onion soup was fine, but I would have expected better. The mains we had a Sea Bass special, which was really good, and the lamb shank, which was just beyond tender... if it wasn&#39;t still attached to the bone, you could have passed it off for pot roast. Service was pretty good... only thing is our waitress did not tell us about 2 of the specials for the night, and the waitress at the next table over did.

The bartender we dealt with was great and attentive to our needs but while he was gone and the lady-tender was there, she pretended like we didn&#39;t exist.

After a few spoonfuls, I noticed what appeared to be meat chunks in the soup. It was verified by my dining companion as meat. I told the folks at the counter and was assured that it wasn&#39;t meat. When pressed, I was told that it was instead garlic. I know what garlic looks and tastes like.    I was offered something else in exchange at no charge. The free substitute was nice, but correct information about the soup&#39;s ingredients would have been much better.

We did receive 3 generous filets and plenty of fried onions.  However, a search for the lobster yielded one tidbit the size of my thumbnail, a few shreds of crab also the size of a small thumbnail and 3 pieces of green stem that were probably asparagus although at first glance I thought they were beans (no asparagus tips were present).  No, we were not expecting a whole or even a half lobster, crab etc.  Nevertheless, I believe based on the description, we should have received pieces that  were recognizable and representative of the species.  In this case, we felt rather  cheated. Most odd, as the remaining items of our dinner were served in generous amounts.

I&#39;ve been eating and ordering delivery from Crif Dogs for 8 years now, since shortly after they opened.  I&#39;ve even written a stellar review here previously, a long while ago. I was still ordering their food last week, when the minimum delivery was supposedly $20. And that was difficult for me. Veggie dogs and fries don&#39;t stay well in the fridge. Two months ago, they told me the minimum delivery was $15. And before that, there was no minimum delivery. What on earth? Terrible way to do business, particularly in this economy, when less people are choosing to spend money to order food from restaurants.      But now, Crif Dogs has truly done something so ridiculous and so horrific, that I question their sanity and suggest they all go see a psychiatrist.  I went to place my order per usual, like I do about every other week. And the woman answering the phone told me to hold on, because she wanted to check the delivery area. I said to her that I realize the minimum delivery went up to $20, as I order there every week or every other week. She said, &quot;Hold on a second. Hold on!&quot; annoyed with me. And I was simply trying to make things easier for her, so she didn&#39;t have to worry about doing any research. Then she said, &quot;I have to check with the kitchen. They gave us a new map, and it&#39;s very clear where the delivery cut-offs are.&quot; So I said, &quot;Well, did the delivery cut-offs change since 2 weeks ago? Because that is when I last ordered.&quot; And she said, &quot;Well, nothing changed. But we have to be more strict about where we deliver to. We may have delivered to you before, because whoever took the call would just place the order. And we can&#39;t call you back and tell you we aren&#39;t going to deliver your order, after we already took the order.&quot; So she said, &quot;Hold on,  I can&#39;t take your order until I ask them.&quot; I waited a while. She came back on and said, &quot;It&#39;s a $50 minimum delivery charge.&quot; I thought I had heard incorrectly. Maybe I need to clean my ears. She said again, &quot;50 bucks. That&#39;s the delivery charge. Do you still want delivery?&quot;  No, of course I don&#39;t want delivery! You people have gone mad! I asked her what exactly was the street cut-off that would make things change from a $20 minimum delivery fee to a $50 minimum delivery free. She told me it was MY BLOCK that was the cut-off.

Honestly, the place isn&#39;t that bad, but there are a couple of things that are important to keep in mind about the restaurant.  The first is that because they stock so much food for their MASSIVE menu, not all of it is going to be particularly good or well-prepared.  I wouldn&#39;t, for example, expect too much of dishes like New Zealand Mussels Marinara or their Chopped Turkey Steak, so it&#39;s no use complaining when you find that none of it tastes particularly gourmet.  Desserts are also the pre-made kind (rarely have I found a city &quot;diner&quot; where this is not the case) so don&#39;t get your hopes up there either.  Secondly, 3 Guys is a restaurant where you need to be conscious of price.  Their regular burger for $6.50 isn&#39;t all that bad, but ordering a Ceasar Salad (off the entree portion of the menu) for about $15 just isn&#39;t worth it.  Essentially, the stuff that&#39;s fine to order are the (relatively) cheap diner staples - think burgers, sandwiches, shakes, waffles - and the stuff to stay away from is food that is complicated and overly expensive.  In regards to service, I have not found that the staff has been memorably rude, but they are not exactly quick to become buddy-buddy with you and will generally only come over to your table if you make it clear that they are wanted.  I have occasionally had to ask my waiter two or three times about my order (&quot;Excuse me, I believe we also had a side of fries with this...&quot;) and the service can be slow even on days where there seem to be few customers, so come knowing what to expect.

My favorite arepa is the Reina Pepiada, which is a delicious chicken and avocado salad. The yoyos - plantains with a tasteless cheese are good, but for the price you should skip what is essentially a few pieces of fried plantain with maple syrup.    The arepas are a great deal at under $7.50. You won&#39;t get too many unique sandwich sized treats for that price in NYC.    The space is a cramped hole in the wall where in typical Manhattan fashion they try and stuff as many people in the room as possible. It has &quot;Manhattan&quot; seating where your table is less than one inch from the next.

So since I don&#39;t work there anymore, I&#39;d like to clarify:    I&#39;m a boy. Evarich can&#39;t seem to decide whether the server was a man or woman in his review. First sign he doesn&#39;t remember it correctly, perhaps?    I had a full restaurant to appease, as we were without our head chef and the kitchen fell apart making incomplete orders and not washing glasses or dishes in an attempt to fix it.  Thus the glass shortage I tried to explain, if his wife would let me get a word in instead of yelling at me.     Evarich and his wife were not friendly in the slightest, they came in with a better than you attitude and served it immediately upon ordering their food and altering their meals without a please or thank you. She  immediately started yelling incoherently at me when I brought her the glasses that WERE washed out with water and dish washing liquid. The cordial glass was the only other one we could find since they refused to use the only other wine glasses we had at the moment. If she calmed down for one second, she&#39;d realize we were trying to serve and accommodate her. She instead chose to be difficult, cause a scene by raising her voice at me, and leave.    They ordered Trapiche Cabernet Sauvignon, not a white wine.     If their son was humiliated, it was by their own ranting and raving behavior, not mine. My &quot;gossip&quot; was informing the bartender/manager they were walking out (on an expensive order) if she wanted to talk to them. The wife proceeded  to get up in my face and called me rude, to which I calmly disagreed, yet apologized (though I didn&#39;t do anything wrong) and wished her a happy holidays. After they left, almost the entire restaurant apologized to me for them. They all thought their tone and attitude toward me was very demeaning and unnecessary. So if they felt mortified, it was because they acted like idiots, and the clientele agreed.    Evarich would have you believe it was my fault they walked out, but it was their own inflated sense of entitlement that I unfortunately couldn&#39;t coddle at the moment that caused them to make the scene they did.    Sorry we couldn&#39;t put our best foot forward that night and that I was rough around the edges (wouldn&#39;t you be if someone treated you that way?), but maybe a little more humility and patience next time, Evarich?'),(992,'107 West','Jeremy','2010-09-08','Good to order','I&#39;ve ordered regularly from 107 west for the past 5 years.

I just finished my &quot;gourmet&quot; pastrami sandwich. It may have been the worst pastrami sandwich I have ever eaten.  I asked the woman at the counter if they made they cooked the pastrami themselves or if it was pre-packaged, she said that they made it there.  HA! the pastrami in my buildings cafeteria is twice as good as this.  In short, the menu is small, the sandwiches un-imaginative, and the value is terrible.  Celebrity chefs should stick to television and leave the sandwich business to the guys that actually slice the meat in front of you.  Two thumbs down.

Some of the sandwiches, i&#39;ll admit, sound pretty eccentric but most of the time when i try them, i am more than pleased.  Eitherway, you have the options of removing ingredients as you see fit for your palette (their website is so easy to order off of).  They do truly use the freshest ingredients.  They receive multilple breakfast and lunch orders from us each week and we also use them for events, such as our board meetings.  For events i&#39;ll call to have them quarter our sandwiches, which they are always happy to do.  I have had nothing but rave reviews.  We always receive our orders in a timely manner and if I stop by to grab a sandwich they are very friendly and don&#39;t seem to take too much time.  I will admit they are a little pricy but in the city, it is sad to say that unless you are going for a slice of pizza, you are probably going to pay at least $10 for your lunch.

If you like real good food - perhaps even if you are a bit of a food snob and you&#39;re tired of most of the sandwich-by-the-numbers fare developed to feed the throngs of bridge-and-tunnel commuters who (it must be admitted) make this city run - then I suggest trying &#39;Wichcraft and its sister enterprises: Craft Bar for upscale dining, and Craft for super-exclusive/expensive dining. The focus is always on the CRAFT (but I&#39;d say more specifiaclly, ART) of cooking at all of these places, and that&#39;s something you taste every time. Interior design and service are never left out of the equation either.

Then we felt too bad to do business there. But the other night we really had a hankering for Vietnamese, so we convinced ourselves that their SIGNIFICANTLY higher prices were helping to pay their workers proper wages. Too bad the food was an utter disappointment; we could barely recognize it from the food Saigon Grill used to serve. The summer rolls were gigantic but had just one bite of shrimp and mint in them; the rest was a heap of dry, tasteless rice vermicelli--note to restaurant: if you&#39;re going to skimp on the good stuff, make the rolls smaller instead of jamming them with  noodles.  The bun xiao (stir fried rice noodles) was much duller in flavor than it used to be, and the quality of beef in the bo luc lac was noticeably worse--lots of tendon and fat; and overcooked, too.

These days I would rate their food mediocre at best. Also, the service has followed suit with distracted servers bringing wrong dishes and forgetting drinks.

Besides being in the neighborhood, it has always had a casual atmosphere that suited a late night meal or a family gathering.  In the past,  it has provided extremely quick service, whether dining in the restaurant or ordering delivery, fresh, good food with great value and most importantly, an overall consistency that was excellent.    This past weekend my family and I went there for dinner, greeted by the friendly chants of ex-employees protesting the new owners for workplace discrimination (This has been going on for quite a while and the owners have placed a plain-clothed security guard at the entrance).  Not to be dissuaded by the protesters, we sat down and immediately noticed how empty the restaurant was for Saturday night at 7PM; it was normal for this place to be bustling on weekend evenings.      On previous occasions, our order would be taken within minutes of sitting down and served minutes later.  Things started off on the wrong foot when we had to flag a waiter down after waiting for him to ask us what we&#39;d like to order.  Next, in a relatively short amount of time, a salad was served to us, but unfortunately it was the wrong salad.  The waiter quickly rectified this and brought the correct salad.  Our entrÃ©es took a noticeably longer time to arrive but this was something we could look past.  Two quick observations about the updated decor: large drapes have been installed over the windows so that customers will not have to look at the protesters outside.  The other this is that there are paintings all over the dining room, wrapped in plastic, with a price tag and contact info for the gentleman selling the work.  We all agreed it was a bit strange...I guess they are diversifying into the art business since their normal customers aren&#39;t showing up.    I personally have ordered every item on the menu MANY MANY times and noticed something was off.  Lets begin with the shrimp summer rolls: looked like it was all vermicelli noodle; no basil or spearmint; very boring.  Next, the beef &amp; papaya salad.  This was good and I found no fault with it.  The next item was a shrimp dish that was frankly very bland with overcooked shrimp.    Please take into account that I came to MP solely to write about this restaurant as I have enjoyed it for a long time and am  sad to see the new owners ruin this restaurant.  I will check back in a month or 2 to see if it has improved.'),(1048,'Saigon Grill','Trevor','2011-03-21','The place has changed','The food appears to be under or over cooked.

The waiter was, by far, the worst part of the evening.  He read the specials to us, treating us like we had never eaten food before...and getting it wrong (he explained that couscous was like a risotto).  When we put in an order of calamari (which was clearly frozen and didn&#39;t have any tentacles in it and didn&#39;t come with an aioli, as adverstised), he insisted we order our full meal.  I said no.  This &quot;wine bar&quot; did not have a bottle of the wine we ordered, and the waiter had no idea of alternatives.  They cleared my date&#39;s food before either of us were done.  And the wait staff just hovered over us all night (not in a good, attentive way).  To cap the evening off, he got our bill completely wrong.    Entrees (filet mignon and fish special) were just okay.  Needless to say, we are never going back.

Quite frankly - big disappointment.The place is packed only because people love the movie - the food and service don&#39;t warrant the foot traffic.The creamy chicken crepe: the crepe itself was good, but the Bechamel sauce that the chicken and veggies were swimming in was bland, and a little on the watery side. There is a reason why salt is a must have in any dish.   The fresh fruit sundae which was good, based on the fact that it was mostly ice cream, which I bet is not homemade. I can say that the ice cream was excellent. The only reason I would return would be to try the pistachio ice cream.  And the infamous frozen hot chocolate. It tastes like a spoon full of ice cream blended with a pound of ice. Watered down and bland.  The bigger problem is all that whipped cream - it&#39;s unsweetened (good way to counter the sweetness of everything else) BUT - it has a very high fat content and I would venture to guess that it is non-dairy. The texture was too slimy and basically ruins the whole dish.  The service was okay, though the busboy was more sociable than the waiter. He was nice, but mostly absent and considering that the service was kind of slow and it took over 20 mins to get the food, it was annoying.

While I never found the staff to be outright rude, they are not warm either, (not the best impression to send the tourists home with but I guess they want to maintain the reputation New Yorkers supposedly have of being unfriendly.) The decor lost it&#39;s charm long ago when it was cleaner and brighter and you weren&#39;t packed in like sardines.    Most importantly the food is just barely average. The main dishes are standard diner fare. The Frozen Hot Chocolate everyone raves about tastes like a frozen McDonald&#39;s shake, nothing special. The biggest sin of all?...they served their ice cream in a very warm glass dish. Most of it melted before I could eat it, very disappointing!

The waiter was very helpful and friendly. His suggestions were right on for us.  We were not rushed at all. We had time constraints ourselves and service was prompt. My pet peeve is  getting served food that is cold. That was not the case at Qi. The food was  freshly made and piping hot. There are a lot of choices for vegetarians and not just the usual stir-fry and noodles or pad thai that tastes like bad chow mein. We had  crispy sesame crusted tofu, served with crushed peanuts and sweet chili dipping sauce. Kind of like mozzarella sticks but with a sesame crust that was both beautiful and tasty.  Asian chive taro corn dumplings were delicious. I am funny with the gelatinous taro served as dim sum but this wasn&#39;t like that at all. The dosa  is a crepe made of lentils and rice  with a filling of your choice. Ours was vegetarian.  It tasted like a French crepe filled with grilled vegetables  perfectly cooked. It easily fed 2 people. The Spicy Holy Basil with imitation duck was  sautÃ©ed fresh basil, chili, garlic, onions, eggplants and bell peppers. I am not sure what duck tastes like anymore but this dish was very well done. The texture of the &quot;duck&quot; was very pleasing. It was a little spicy for  my companion but perfect for me, just a little sniffle in my nose. Not so spicy hot that you can&#39;t taste the food. I like to try several dishes at a meal.

Meanwhile we ordered a bottle of wine at the bar while we waited and the waitress poured us each some wine and the remainder that was in the bottle was left on the bar. 10 minutes later when I turned back to the bar to refill my glass the wine bottle was gone. Instead of giving us a round of drinks, the waitress poured the most minuscule amount of wine into only my glass.    When we were finally taken to our table (about an hour late) we find out that it&#39;s situated directly next to a HUGE cement column but with about 4 inches between the column and the bench we were supposed to sit on.

We were also almost completely cut off from the rest of the restaurant due to this column.    The meal was okay at best. The appetizers were pretty good but the mains were subpar.

Now it was cool in there but the hostess immediately informed us that they were only serving soup. On a hot day, soup is the last thing I want. It was late in the afternoon and the dining room was very empty. So we asked if we could order tacos next door and come and eat them in the cool room. We were told no, that was not allowed. We were running out of time so we went back to the Corner Deli part and resigned ourselves to sweating into our tacos. Thatâ&euro;&trade;s not super bogus, but what we watched them do to another group was. Two young ladies were trying to find a cool spot in the Corner Deli. They couldnâ&euro;&trade;t so they went outside to sit in the tables out front. All of which were empty, because, you know, 100 degrees. They hadnâ&euro;&trade;t even gotten their food before someone from the dining room next door came out to inform they couldnâ&euro;&trade;t sit there. Never mind that these girls had also tried to eat in the dining room but were turned off by the seriously limited menu. Never mind that no one else was sitting at any of these tables. Never mind that it was over 100 degrees outside and as a special day, maybe they could cut people some slack. No, despite the fact that these girls were paying customers, La Esquina kicked them off the table.

The hostess walks you through the kitchen and a maze of hallways to your table. The atmosphere is amazing down there. Simply more than I anticipated or expected. Candelabras adorn the room and the low ceilings give it a cave-like feel. Our server was great and we promptly order the blood orange margaritas. They were a little small and weak for the price ($13), but tasty. We ordered a sampling of some different small plates and everything we ate was fantastic. We got another round of margaritas and these were a bit stronger this time. Half way through our meal our male server disappeared and was replaced with a woman who took care of us just as well. We didn&#39;t feel at all rushed and we soaked up the atmosphere as it started to get busier as the night wore on. The only one downfall of the place are the prices. You spend a lot for a little. The plates are big and $10 for 2 tiny tacos is a lot. We spent more than half the bill on the drinks. But you are paying for the atmosphere and the exclusivity of the place.

Needless to say, my co-worker and I always write it off as a NYC lunch problem. But today may be the last straw for me. It was a &#39;snow day&#39; in New York and we figured it would be empty and our wait would be reasonable. Well, we were 50% right on that and I&#39;m sure you know which part I&#39;m talking about. There was one other person in there and it still took 20 minutes (for 2 grilled cheeses and 2 cups of soup). When we finally made it back to our office, both of us had received the wrong soup.

It was a shame given how nice the main room is.  One advice, avoid the back room if you can. To be honest such a quality restaurant should not have that many &quot;second tier&quot; tables.

There were 2 amuse bouche, a pumpkin soup and  salmon terrine with salmon roe on  top, and underneath the terrine, osetra caviar with just a bit of creme fraiche. That was the perfect start to our meal. We both liked it very much. The tasting menu didn&#39;t include the foie gras [or at least we didn&#39;t notice it]. We&#39;re both foie gras fans so we both ordered foie gras as our appetizer. It was just the way it is supposed to be: it melted in your mouth. Hubby and I had fish as our entree; he had the cod and I had the sea bass. Both were well-seasoned and meticulously done. For dessert, we just had room for one so we asked that we share the amaretto flan. The flan was accompanied by caramelized banana, which to my surprise, was not too sweet. Dessert  was perfect.

The earlier seating still wasn&#39;t finished. And this was the case for DOZENS of reservations. We had to wait 1/2 hr - in the cramped entrance way with 2 inpatient kids. Once we were seated - no  staff came to see us for almost 10 mins. We had to flag the bus boy down for some water. The waitress came by in another 5 minutes (15 min before seeing a waitress). Gives us our menu and disappears. 10 minutes later comes back and takes our drink and guacamole order.  Drinks and guacamole come in a few minutes. But waitress doesn&#39;t takes our meal order when delivering the drinks - she disappears again.  We are almost finished the guacamole before she appears again (over 10 minutes). The entrees arrive in a reasonable time. But we have don&#39;t tortillas for the tacos. The waitress notices and says they&#39;ll come in a second. Minutes past and we&#39;re eating without tortillas. We ask a busboy and then try one of the MANY managers to get some. And finally after 10 minutes they arrived. They don&#39;t bring enough and are quickly gone - we have to ask 3 different people again for more. Finally a busboy brings them.  We don&#39;t order dessert but one of the kids gets ice cream included with his children&#39;s meal.   The waitress takes the order and gets the check ready. Check comes - still no ice cream. We were leaving when the kid remembers we never got his ice cream. Again we flag down 2 waitresses and 2 bus boys.  After close to 15 minutes he finally gets his single scoop of ice cream. During this entire meal the waitress who was very pleasant but never came by to check on us.  They might rushed for the holidays, but this is restaurant across the street from Lincoln Center so they specialize in theater crowds. I have been to many restaurants in the LC and theater districts- never had these problems. They kept saying they were overwhelmed but shouldn&#39;t they expect that as they specialize in serving the LC crowd. I don&#39;t think it should take 2hrs for guacamole and tacos.

The only thing that was worth it was the food which was good.  The service was subpar as our food order was taken by a girl with no personality, service was extremely slow (brought coffee but no cream, then asked if customer wanted cream, and the coffee was cold when she returned with the cream).  The waitress did not ever come back to ask if we wanted anything else or if our food was good.

We sent back 3 out of 7 meals (the corn dogs were actually edible so one child even got to eat). 2 adults ordered extremely expensive adult beverages which the bartender was unable to make palatable in any way. However, my pepsi was completely drinkable. For this wonderful experience, we had the bargain price of 148.00. Which, even after reminding the manager that 3 meals were inedible, did not get lowered in any way. The four ones that were actually partially eaten, were not caviar or filet mignon. This place is not only a complete rip off, but the management is incompetent, obnoxious, and has no people skills whatsoever. I have never been so unimpressed with a restaurant in my life. I am hoping none of my children will contract food poisoning from this incredibly repulsive experience. I am actually tempted to stand outside with a sign warning off any unwary tourists who might think that this would be a good place to eat.

The person who ordered the cod actually sent it back and ordered something else hoping that it would be less bland! Unfortunately for him, the lamb shank was only slightly less bland. The only happy person was the one who ordered the burger. Organic and locally grown does not mean unseasoned and tasteless, does it? On the bright side, I would definitely go back for drinks!'),(1326,'ABC Kitchen','Mike R','2011-04-13','Obnoxious reservations... but everything else is perfection','ABC definitely attends the Keith McNally school of reservations -- only 5:30 or 11 available no matter what, even for a Monday in 2013. It usually takes me a couple of calls to find a reservationist who will give me a more reasonable time.    Regardless of reservation, you will wait at least 15 mins for your table, so grab a cocktail at the bar, which is among the best bar spaces in Manhattan.    Once you make it past the reservation/seating phase, the entire experience is perfection. ABC has enough ambience and style for every Keith McNally restaurant combined.     Every item on the menu rates around a 10/10, but the squash toast is literally one of the best things I&#39;ve ever put in my mouth (and that&#39;s saying a lot).     The service, once you are seated, is impeccable in every way.    For my birthday, I only go to restaurants I&#39;ve never been to before -- but this year I am making an exception because ABC is that special.'),(1327,'ABC Kitchen','PPP','2011-03-10','lovely lunch','My sister and I recently wandered in to ABC Kitchen . We had been wanting to try it for some time and were welcomed by friendly hostesses who found us a spot immediately. The squash toast  was buttery and decadent, and the crab toast was superb. We shared an apple and pear salad, it was  delicate  and mysterious.  The service was seamless.'),(1328,'ABC Kitchen','M Marks The Spot','2011-01-11','Ambiance Central','Considering the hype and effort to get a reservation, I still feel underwhelmed and a tad disappointed from last week&#39;s brunch at ABC Kitchen... however, I&#39;m so enthralled with the space, ingredients and even dishware that I feel compelled to write regardless...    The inside of Jean-Georges Vongerichten&#39;s ABC Kitchen is whimsical&amp;hip. delicate&amp;rustic.  country&amp;urban.  cozy&amp;breezy.  Sam Sifton of the NY Times describes it best when he says &quot;...the place is haute organic and Hamptons sustainable.... airy and open and relaxed the way the second homes of the wealthy often are...&quot; So true - It does feel like my [non-existent] vacation home.    The space is best understood by going in person - beautiful lighting, a motley assembly of country chic furniture and pieces of grandma&#39;s chipped china thrown in for good measure - it all creates a mini cloud of luxury within the not so glamorous Flatiron/Union Square area.  Tapping the ABC Carpet &amp; Home inventory, Kitchen uses sustainable, handcrafted pieces by local artisans as well as the indigenous Mapuche people of Patagonia.  The waitstaff, in their oh-so-cute plaid shirts, are perky and fresh faced... I swear, straight out of a Neutrogena commercial.    As for the food...mmehhhh.  I shared a plate of Cured Meats and Local Cheeses ($17) with the table and then had a bowl of homemade yogurt with dates and granola.  Nothing was &quot;spectacular&quot; but certainly fresh in taste and well presented.  I attribute my lack luster reaction to poor ordering (bad M!) - their Housemade Ricotta Ravioli ($22) and the Spinach, Goat Cheese and Herb Pizza ($14) both look/smell incredible!  Their coffee, I must note, was outstanding and came in amazing pieces of pottery that practically molded into your hand.  Given the quality of the ingredients, prices were quite reasonable.    I believe in second chances and plan to head back to ABC Kitchen for Part Deux: Dinner &amp; Drinks.'),(1329,'ABC Kitchen','Matt','2010-12-04','Over promise, under deliver','Not worth the trip.  Have been excited about going to this place for some time.  We could only get a late reservation, but figured if we sat down at 10:00 (the time of the reservation) that would be fine.  We had heard great things and really were hoping to not be disappointed.    We literally waited 35 minutes to be seated, during which we received perhaps one comment from a hostess that they were sorry we were waiting.  As the 30 minute mark approached, they starting promising to &quot;take care of us&quot; over and over and over again, so we didn&#39;t really complain and just dealt with the absurdly long wait.    The food was good - not the best we&#39;ve had - but some things really did stand out (the squash toast was superb).  Others, like the cod, were absolutely drenched in oil/grease and simply did not taste good.      When the bill came, we were surprised to see that the only way they &quot;took care of us&quot; was bringing us a cheap appetizer for free.  Normally I would be fine with that, but when you&#39;re not seated until 10:45 and it&#39;s already that late and you&#39;re promised to be taken care of by 4 different people, it&#39;s almost a slap in the face that our drinks or dessert or something else wasn&#39;t done to make us feel better about what shaped up to be a less-than-memorable experience.    In the past, when this has happened at other restaurants, we&#39;ve had managers come over and profusely apologize and comp our entire meals, or our drinks, or bring us multiple dishes as a means of apologizing for a mistake they made.  When you have hostesses constantly stating they&#39;ll take care of you and then the waiter reiterating this, we were frankly appalled by ABC&#39;s lack of client service.  You simple won&#39;t make it in this city if you can&#39;t treat your clientele with the respect they deserve.    I don&#39;t care how good or new a restaurant you are - if you can&#39;t seat your customers within a reasonable time of arriving, you&#39;re failing.  And if that does happen, you need to make much more of an effort to appease those who clearly are frustrated - especially when it&#39;s that late in the evening and they&#39;ve been waiting to eat for so long.  It really is a shame.'),(1330,'ABC Kitchen','Lorrie Stuart','2010-11-13','Just. Plain. Yummy','Having had several highly mediocre meals of late at fairly fancy restaurants, I had no particular expectations for ABC.  I was therefore beyond delighted with my lunch there today.  The food was fresh, inventive, and absolutely delicious. Our shared crabmeat toast came as a very generous portion, with a wonderful lemon aioli that perfectly complimented the crab.  And my cheeseburger-- wow!  The pickled jalapenos added a really interesting topnote, as did the arugula which substituted for the usual boring lettuce.

As at lunch, the food was simply outstanding: the memory of the foie gras appetizer with a creme brulee-type topping will stay with me for quite awhile.  The room was very relaxing and, happily, not deafeningly noisy, even though it was full.  And the prices, even at dinner, are not outrageous by NYC standards.  Unfortunately, the service was another question.  My hosts were members of the family that owns a very well-known liquor brand and, naturally, ordered that brand.  The restaurant no longer carries it, and the manager to whom we spoke made no attempt to resolve the situation (at these still-very-high prices, they could have sent someone out to buy a bottle at a nearby liquor store).  In addition, although our first course arrived &quot;on time,&quot; there was a 35-minute wait until we got our next course.  I would return to the restaurant again for the excellent cuisine, but cannot fully recommend it, given the above.'),(1336,'Nougatine','anonymous','2010-05-01','Wonderful!','THE place to go when you want a really nice restaurant with great atmosphere and amazing food.

The fact that the place was mobbed was indication that this is so.  And everything about our experience supported the high ratings it has received.  The service was lovely, including the cheery hostess who seated us soon after we arrived, even though we were 20 minutes early.  The atmosphere is cozy and -- amazingly, considering the crowd -- quite bearable, noise-wise.  The food followed suit.

The first thing you need to know that Metro is an upper Westside diner so it&#39;s not cheap, but the portion sizes are hearty, food is fresh and tasty. My favorites are the turkey burgers, Mediterranean turkey burgers are great they add green peppers, onion and seasonings blended in the patty. If you want it without the feta and pita ask for it on any type of bread and cheese u like. Fried chicken dinner is surprisingly good (has a little soul in it), love the shrimp salad but U have to be assertive when ordering on the phone about the amount they give you or they will skimp on the shrimp.

Thatâ&euro;&trade;s probably why I order take-out there two or three times a week.  But the food quality?  Wildly uneven.  Sometimes itâ&euro;&trade;s very good. An omelette done just right; a generous serving of moist, tender chicken.  Other times, it disappoints. A skimpy serving of fries, or dry, overcooked chicken.  It depends on whoâ&euro;&trade;s in the kitchen any given day.      One major problem: the countermen who put together take-out orders.  Five times out of ten, they get something wrong.  Home fries when I order French.  Well done when I order medium. Rice pudding when I asked for bread pudding.  Either thereâ&euro;&trade;s a communication gap between wait staff and cooks, or no one checks an order before it goes out to make sure itâ&euro;&trade;s right. The emphasis seems to be on speed instead of accuracy, and (with one notable exception) customer service seems like a foreign concept.  I had one major fiasco with a sit-down meal there.  Having ordered chicken scampi, I was served a dry slab of breaded chicken cutlet no sauce in sight.  I asked the waiter what happened to the sauce.  A few minutes later he brings an odd creamy tomato sauce!  Did he think I was so stupid I couldnâ&euro;&trade;t tell the difference between this travesty and scampi?  Was he afraid to face the cook and ask him to make it right?  The regular manager wasnâ&euro;&trade;t there that night, so I ate it and fumed. The next time I went to the Metro, I described the scenario to an uber manager from the parent company. He apologized profusely but nothing was rectified. Will I continue to go to the Metro?

The Strip House came highly recommended so we made reservations for our party of 6. Unfortunately, The Strip House was one of the worst experiences  I have ever encountered. We  were seated promptly . The atmosphere was cozy and interesting as we were welcomed.. Our waiter recited the specials perfectly yet that was to be the last professional behavior we would witness from him. Proper service &amp; attitude went downhill from that point on.   Our first choice of wine was not available, that was understandable &amp;  no big deal.  As we reviewed the wine list again our â&euro;&tilde;surly waiterâ&euro;&trade; became impatient. We asked him about another wine on the list, he arrogantly remarked, &#39;itâ&euro;&trade;s a dry red ......&#39; shrugging in a condescending manner.  We ordered  six appetizers (scallops) and wanted to split entrees since we had  a large lunch earlier. His response was a curt, â&euro;&tilde;we donâ&euro;&trade;t work that way!â&euro;&trade;as he turned on his heel and walked away. He returned to our table pressing us to order in a brusque tone. It was quite uncomfortable.   The watier returned with the wine &amp; glasses were quickly sloshed with wine &amp; refilled immediately upon a few sips. Our appetizers &amp; entrees were brought hurriedly to the table all at one time. Which was not a surprise as he had proclaimed that he was bringing everything out together as he briskly walked away. He didnt ask us, he told us!   Obviously, the  intention was to feed us as fast as possible and turn our table quickly.    We decided that staying for dessert and after dinner drinks &amp; coffee would be enjoyed  at a different establishment. We reluctantly left a 20 percent tip which he did not deserve. I would have preferred to tip his assist staff who  were much more gracious.  Certainly the rudeness &amp; haughtiness displayed by our particular waiter means that I will never step foot in this restaurant again.  There are many other great steakhouses in NYC that appreciate your business.'),(1407,'Strip House','ironchefchinois','2009-12-23','Garlic bread and chocolate cake a must!','Went the Strip House the previous Monday for a post birthday dinner. Had some initial concerns due to the fact that my wife and I were up early and around town most of the day and were dressed comfortably because of this. Most of the clientel at the restaurant were dressed like they were going to a Goldman Sachs board meeting. The staff was friendly despite our casual attire and service was great except for one hiccup where were were charged for someone else&#39;s $40 glass of wine that the manager quickly fixed after we called them back.  The food was great, loved the garlic bread with fondue and the 12+ layer chocolate cake was a hit. The steak was solid but I have noticed a trend with the strips in NYC not being very tender but I don&#39;t hold that against the restaurant,  could be the distributor or maybe that&#39;s how locals like their steak.  The meat flavor was very similar to Peter Luger&#39;s, think for tenderness, Del Frisco&#39;s has the edge. It is clearly a quality dining destination as it was packed on a Monday evening.

Some bites were great, others were so charred on the outside it was really burned and the taste would not leave my (or her) mouth, (and we ordered it med-rare).

The reservationist repeated the reservation with some random date a month later I corrected her and she then confirmed that I was all set to eat that Saturday. I arrive at the restaurant on-time and they can&#39;t find the reservation (she had not corrected the mistake). The manager came over and seemed aggrivated and kept shaking his head. He made it completely obvious that he thought I showed up without a reservation and when I told him that I did not appreciate the way they were handling the matter he snapped that he was doing me a service by letting me know we&#39;re lucky if he could seat our party (9 people) at any point in the evening let alone on-time and that&#39;s it not his problem. 45 minutes later they sat us at the bar--cramped---we had a great reunion and spent $2,500. I&#39;m really not sure how they get by in the recession with that attitude. I am glad the rest of my party was not there initially to witness or be a part of this poor treatment. Fast forward 3 weeks and the restaurant calls to confirm my reservation. They still hadn&#39;t corrected the mistake!! Any way, they are clearly incompetent and rude in my eyes.

I just had dinner at The Dutch this evening.  My boyfriend and I had each a starter and an entree. Starter was okay nothing amazing but still good: beet salad and tartare.  For our entrees we both ordered the dry aged NY strip. I ordered medium rare and my boyfriend ordered rare/bloody. When our entrees arrived at the table we both notice that the steaks looked like they were cooked the same, medium rare. We pointed this out to our waitress who assured him that is was rare. Considering the dim lighting we assumed she was correct. But we cut into the center of the steak and still found it to be in fact medium and nothing close to rare. We asked a table service man to take it back and replaced it with a rare steak. 10 minutes pass and the Manager comes to our table with the same steak butchered into thin slices. He then starts giving us a tutorial on how steak is cooked and what is the definition of rare. I then cut into my steak (medium rare) and place the meat next to the &quot;rare&quot; steak which looks exactly the same.   In the end we ended up eating the damn thing because it was getting late in the evening and it was just really humiliating the way we were being treated.    The music was little loud but not obnoxiously so;    Drinks: I don&#39;t drink so much but I do have wine for dinner and the selection by the glass was not bad. Typically in most restaurants you would get such. But this not not enough for me to ever come back to this restaurant.

Then we had fish for main course, the branzino and fish of the day, both of which I could had done at home. At least when I go to a serious restaurant the branzino would have been deboned. They charge the same price at  Prune,  they just stuff it with some lemon and herbs and throw it on grill. Very messy to eat. the bread was stale.  The table was small and a piece of junk. Our bill for 2 people was $131 ust for 2 measly appetizers and 2 fish and a $40 bottle of wine. We decided to go to a nearby bakery to buy pastries and sweets  because we were still hungry. The place is dirty, shabby chic  is not charming, just shabby,  and unremarkable food. I don&#39;t understand what all the fuss is about.

What most of the reviewers  here miss is the key ingredient at Prune:  a sense of community.  I don&#39;t know how they do it, but everybody in the restaurant feels and acts like part of a big family at home.  We sat along the wall and--somehow--there was a birthday at every table. By the end of the night, we were all talking to each other.  In the midst of what is most often a snootier-than-thou LES, Chef Gabrielle and her staff have figured out a way to make everyone feel comfortable in their skin and the result is an experience of dining that I&#39;ve only found previously in a hill town trattoria in Umbria and a ferme in the Luberon.       And here&#39;s the trick, I think:  the comfort is cultivated by the presentation, the decor, and the staff--but it begins with the recipes themselves.  The food wraps its arms around everyone at the table--everyone in the room--as opposed to pushing you back in your seat to applaud its virtuoso performance.  So many restaurants in NYC serve food that turns patrons into the chef&#39;s applauding audience. Prune serves food that turns us to each other, smiling and talking.  In another country, another time, perhaps, this is what eating was meant to be.  And here it is.    Given all that, the only thing stopping me from going back tonight is a mild protest from my carotid artery, which is still trying to understand what it did wrong to be punished by an appetizer of roasted marrow bones and toast.       Nobody can create and maintain a place like this without committing her whole being to the project.   And for that, a deep bow of gratitude to the folks at Prune.'),(1447,'Prune','Angelique CondÃ©','2009-06-10','Utter Disappointment','For quite some time now, I have heard that Prune boasts not only the best Bloody Mary but the best brunch in NYC.  While I did not expect Prune to live up to these unrealistic expectations, I was looking forward to an enjoyable and tasty brunch.  Two weeks ago, my wife and I went to Prune, understanding the no reservations policy, and upon hearing of the 1hr+ wait, decided to find another restaurant but to return the following weekend prepared for the wait.  This past Saturday, we went to Prune, gave our names to the gracious hostess (perhaps the best aspect of the Prune experience for me), learned again of the 1hr+ wait and happily walked around wasting time before our brunch.  1 hour and 45 minutes later, we were seated and approached about 10 mins later by a busgirl attempting to take our drink orders.  Since we did not have menus, neither of us were prepared and this young lady was fairly rude about that.  The busgirl returned to take our orders and the Bloody Mary that followed was tasty and unusual.  Unfortunately, my wife&#39;s coffee didn&#39;t arrive and I had to ask for it, much to my waitress&#39;s dismay.  Speaking of our surly waitress, I can&#39;t remember the last time I have been treated more rudely or with more apathy for our presence.  This waitress pretty much let us know that she didn&#39;t care that we were there, ignored us and was VERY unfriendly and not helpful at all regarding any questions we might have regarding the unusual but intriguing menu.  I can&#39;t express enough how much this waitress turned me off to Prune and pretty much put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day.  I ordered the Spicy Chickpea dish with the buttered eggs, thinking it would be interesting and tasty but unfortunately, after a lengthy wait, I was not only disappointed with the less than average taste but the paltry size of the dish.  My wife ordered the huevos rancheros, which were JUST OK.  All in all, I had two of the ____ Matchbox Bloody Marys and each of us had our main dish...the total for the meal before tip was about $80, which is expensive but not too crazy for this town.  In retrospect, the service was very poor and I am easy to please (this is my first bad review ever) and desperately wanted to be happy about the experience.  The food was certainly not terrible but it was disappointing.  The Bloody Mary was good but NOT the best in town.  I will NEVER go back and would never recommend Prune to a friend.'),(1448,'JoJo','miya68','2011-03-21','Service and Setting Issues','The food was not so bad and quite reasonable if you go for the pre-fixed menus.

He also rushed  us to order food and drinks and kept serving food so fast so they can have more seating after us. We finished 3 course meal within a hour after seating.  I felt as if I was eating on the airplane. In a way, it was fine. Because we didn&#39;t want to stay there so long. The room, tables and chairs are so small, cramped and stuffy.

Other than that the food was very good - highly recommend the warm asparagus salad and tuna roll. Chicken was delish but too salty.

Our recent experience will result in it being a one-time visit.  Calamari with olive dip was simple and straightforward without subtleties of flavors, and a bit salty.  But the real salt bomb was the salmon dish&#39;s whipped potatoes and the sauce as well.  The salt is out of control, and I usually like salt.  Was the chef in a bad mood and taking it out on diners?  We&#39;ll never know, but the dishes went back to the kitchen.  The sauce on the steak was also super salty.  Service was good, although we wanted to pour our own water but one person after another came over and quickly grabbed and poured the bottle.

I had to lean forward many times throughout my entire meal so the waiter can get to the table inches behind me and the table inches next to me (and of course bump into me each time), and my friend had to stand up and move his chair out of the way twice to let other diners to and from the table next to us. Not pleasant.   2. Service â&euro;&ldquo; just poor, uncoordinated service from the kitchen and out. Unless if you consider being without menus for 15 minutes (we ultimately requested them) and offered the wine list 3 times from three different waiters as â&euro;&oelig;attentive serviceâ&euro;?, Iâ&euro;&trade;m not sure why you would say their service is great.   3. Food â&euro;&ldquo; definitely have had much much (much!) better Italian food elsewhere. a. Appetizer: We ordered the special appetizer â&euro;&oelig;Boiled Octopus with Chopped Beans, Celery, Avocado, Grape Tomatoes, and Balsamic Vinegarâ&euro;?. When the order came, the avocado was missing and so was the balsamic vinegar. The server had to bring back to kitchen and fix the dish â&euro;&ldquo; but even after the addition of some dressingâ&euro;¦ the dish was still bland and underwhelming. Also, we asked them to grill the octopus instead of boiling and their excuse for not doing so was that the kitchen was too busy, which was not true (you can see into the kitchen) and made no sense since thereâ&euro;&trade;s a grilled squid entrÃ©e on the regular menu. b. Main Course: We ordered a special Filet of Dover Soleâ&euro;¦ not sure if there is a better way to put this but â&euro;¦ it looked like a wet sock, felt like a wet sock, and tasted like a wet sock. And at $45? The value to price ratio is negative. c. The Pappardelle Bolognese was better than the Dover Sole (but what wouldnâ&euro;&trade;t be). Pasta was done just right, the sauce was not amazing and had no depth but was edible, and the meat was dry. Meh. d. Dessert: Napolean. They got the 2.0 stars from this dish. Cream was not too heavy, almost vanilla pudding like but lighter; the layers were thin and crispy; Raspberries added a light tartness / freshness to the dish.

However, the food was a supreme disappointment. The restaurant feigns the appearance of an authentic Italian restaurant. However, the selection, preparation, and taste not only belie this claim of authenticity, but also left me completely dissatisfied with my meal.    We got the prix fixe menu, and this is the first time that I can say I was honestly insulted by the food that the chef chose to serve to us. The first course was fine, but completely unmemorable. The second course consisted of meatballs, pasta, and panini. The pasta was rigatoni covered in oily cheese; it was nothing more in substance or taste than mac and cheese. The meatballs were meatballs and the panini was panini. Both are dishes that would never be served as a main course at an Italian restaurant. All of the main courses were incredibly cheap dishes with a very large mark up.    If the main course didn&#39;t confirm that the owner seemed more intent to make money than to serve decent food, the desert left me feeling completely cheated. &quot;Panna cotta&quot; was served, but I&#39;m still not convinced it wasn&#39;t greek yogurt. And if I hadn&#39;t had my fill of panini, the meal with a desert panini made from nutella on toasted white bread.    I left disappointed, and my Italian girlfriend left insulted.

After arguing with me about this for five minutes, the maitre d showed me his watch to prove me wrong - and it STILL wouldn&#39;t have put us arriving 10 minutes late!  So basically, they gave away our table after THREE minutes.  Unheard of at any good restaurant in NY and even worse as I was on a business lunch.  When we requested logical solutions like putting together two tables to accomodate us, they were having none of it.  Eventually, he said &#39;I&#39;m not talking to you anymore.  You won&#39;t eat lunch here today.  I will not serve you&#39; and stood silently like a child even though we were respectful and trying to be constructive the whole time.

The taste of the rice was good, it got a very tokyo style sting to it, though the rice was not properly prepared. It was starchy. Atmosphere at Yasuda is flawless and you can see the sushi chefs have their own personalities as you can see some of them laugh, and some of them just stare grin at you. I think that the reason Yasuda has such a pretty high rating is the personality of the chefs and how the restaurant handles its nazi style reservation system.

Sushi Yasuda did have pretty good selection of fish including some that I had not heard of even in Japan. Must have been unconventional sushi materials. So I was very interested and wanted to know about them but our sushi-chef was very non-interesting, non-entertaining one and all he said was &quot;it&#39;s good&quot; or &quot;would taste like mackerel&quot; when asked questions. No, the language was not the issue as the chef and I are both Japanese and we were speaking in our native language. And no, it wasn&#39;t so busy that he couldn&#39;t stop his hand for 5 seconds to have a little talk. Of course chef&#39;s 1st priority is not to chat with customers, but to make a good food, which he did an okay job of, except when he put too much sea salt or brushed too much soy sauce on sushi pieces. But the real good sushi chefs i know would be able to give you information on what they are serving with some interesting stories without being chatty. In general the people work there seem to be dead inside or something. They are doing their jobs, but just don&#39;t seem to care much. The quality of the food - Okay. It&#39;s not bad for the price (2 of us had belly full of sushi, 2 appetizers, beer and carafes of sake for $230 before tip) but nothing was remarkable either.

I was eagerly anticipating this evening but left never having been seated or given an apology. In addition, my complaint letter was never responded to.  Too bad. My recomendation to Mr. Samuelson is to make sure that his restaurant is running up to his exacting standards, or stop going on TV saying that it&#39;s terrific (because it isn&#39;t). Until he corrects that glaring problems, i for one will not return.'),(1592,'Red Rooster Harlem','DKBK','2011-06-28','Good vibe, poor service','Went with my daughter.  Enjoyed the live jazz.  Poor service though tainted the overall quality of the meal.  They really need to fix this.'),(1593,'Red Rooster Harlem','dee dee','2011-06-14','Never again','As someone who comes from a family and friends that cook down home southern food.. I was sorely disappointed because I was expecting something great ... At best I would call it imitation soul food. The decor was great but the food wasn&#39;t good for the money.'),(1594,'Red Rooster Harlem','Aaron','2011-05-28','Not recommended','Don&#39;t bother.  We thought a top chef would have top quality food.  Not really.  I had the Fried Yard Bird and was very disappointed.  A chicken leg and a back  smothered in paprika and cayenne for $21.00 with a few greasy collard greens.    Are they kidding?  I will never go back.'),(1595,'Red Rooster Harlem','Adrienne','2011-05-16','Birthday Disappointment.......','Its the perfect place to go, if you should happen to have 45 to an hour to waste!- Hopefully you wont be hungry, because this is the expected time frame you&#39;ll have to wait prior to receiving your food!!  You&#39;d think the fact that I mentioned it was my boyfriend&#39;s birthday would&#39;ve made a difference,... clearly it did not, and excuse me for being slightly annoyed by the fact that one of the mangers had the audacity to question the AMOUNT of time we waiting rather than offer an apology! To compensate for the inconvenience, we were given to watered down house versions of so-called martinis combined with a cupcake as hard as concrete!! SMH!! Do ME a favor, although we&#39;ve never met, SAVE your money since I cant get mine back.'),(1596,'Red Rooster Harlem','judi','2011-05-07','The food was excellent','The title of my review is exactly what I told one of the owners when he approached my table. The Blackened Catfish with a side order of creole grits were filling and seasoned well. My friendgirl said her salad tasted as if it was picked that day from the garden. However, the bread served prior to the meal was tough and cold. Our waiter was was informative and engaging. One of the owners also approached the table. While the first owner shook hands, listened quickly, and left, the second owner was more conversant. It was he I told that the table where we sat was not conducive for conversation. It was more of picnic style, seating six, three on one side and three on the other. The restaurant felt more like three restaurants;the bar;the round tables and then where we sat, in front of the chefs. It took two months to get in. While the food was great, somehow I expected more from the atmosphere and the patrons. President Obama dined here, so I expected to be amazed. I wasn&#39;t. Will I return? Sure, but I won&#39;t be knocking anybody down to get there.'),(1597,'Jewel Bako','somerandonguy','2011-05-19','Epic!!!','Simply put jewel bako is the gold standard.'),(1598,'Jewel Bako','Brian','2010-09-19','Best Sushi in E Village, by far','I had my first meal at Jewel Bako on a Friday at 9:30 and I wish I had tried this fantastic place sooner. I called to check on seating; the phone was answered immediately by a live human being who told me to come on in. The bar was full and the dining room was 75% full so we were seated at a table near the front door. My date and I both ordered the sushi omakase. I asked to have the pieces served in multiple courses instead of one big platter and the host accomodated me. Most places won&#39;t do that.  We both found that every piece was excellent. Properly sized small to be eaten in one bite; not too much rice; perfect temperature; dense, flavorful, fresh. All the pieces were spieled expertly by the host, who was our server. Half of them were from Japan.  It was much better sushi than my previous neighborhood favorite Hasaki, though I still love their red miso soup and other wonderful cooked dishes. Kanoyama on the other hand can&#39;t hold a candle to Jewel Bako in my opinion, in food quality, service and the room. The last time I had sushi and sake I liked this much was at Sushi Seki, and I paid a bit more and ate in a much plainer room.  The sashimi amuse-bouche and white miso soup we started with were also very good. The comped green tea ice cream sandwich at the end was superb both in presentation and the eating. I was happy with all the decor and tableware choices. The wasabi was fresh, as I would expect, but grating it at tableside is a nice way to educate patrons who may not have known the difference.  The sushi omakase was 55 per and then we spent about another 80 each on alcohol. The sake and wine list is easy to use with clear descriptions of the sake available. The pour is done at the table which I appreciate. There&#39;s a good selection of European wine styles along with the sake--a welcome touch that is missing at most neighborhood Japanese fine dining places.   They played lounge downtempo music the whole time, which I find unobjectionable but soulless. I&#39;d appreciate them mixing it up a little in the spirit of the neighborhood. Frank restaurant, around the corner, does such a good job of this.  This is my new favorite downtown Japanese restaurant.'),(1599,'Jewel Bako','monie','2010-03-13','really delicious','i went to jewel bako on a sat night with my husband and had an amazing experience.  i got the sushi roll tasting &amp; he got the sushi/sashimi tasting.  the fish was so fresh &amp; different than any other sushi restaurant in nyc.  i wish my meal had like 1 or 2 extra pieces but other than that it was perfect, next time i might order an extra piece of sashimi (it&#39;s too good, you just want to keep eating!!)  we got the delicious ice cream sandwich for dessert and they brought us 2!!  so yummy!  the whole meal was perfection!'),(1600,'Jewel Bako','HEF','2009-12-31','Fantastic','Sounds like HJ has some kind of self-image issue - we have never worn a suit or taken a credit card to JB and have had great service and a great experience all the way.  Went for our anniversary last year and returning for New Years this year...always a very interesting selection of fish (not just the basics), fresh and well prepared.  Compared with a lot of high-end sushi joints, very reasonably priced.'),(1601,'Jewel Bako','HJ','2009-11-17','insulting service ruins perfectly good sushi','good sushi in a nice dinning  room jam packed with the corporate set trying to feel hip and in the know in East Vill. wear a suit and take your corporate card or you&#39;ll be treated like rotten fish in this lovely little spot.'),(1602,'Jewel Bako','Citygirl','2009-10-25','Wonderful experience','Jewel Bako is still great. The fish is fresher than ever, I mean melt in your mouth good. Service is just lovely and the place is particularly beautiful, designed with elegance and comfort in mind, despite the small space.     Order the yellowtail sampler appetizer and the Japanese snow crab roll.     I&#39;ll be back after the next couple paychecks.'),(1603,'Jewel Bako','mm','2009-10-14','Most uncomfortable','this place was too small and too &quot;trendy&quot; super annoying. sushi was pretty delicious i must say, but not worth sitting in that annoying space and that tiny table.');
